# PortalsOfPreggo
A pregnancy expansion for Portals of Phereon.

# Content
- Female/Futa characters have menstrual cycles
- All (pretty much all) sexual activity involving both a penis and a vagina will cause sperm transfer into the recipient
- the contents (ovums, eggs, sperm) of a character's uterus is displayer via a small window

  it can be expanded to show the name and species of the donor
- eggs are formed in the womb after a successful impregnation

  they take time to grow, and are added to the egg inventory after birth
- eggs keep track of who the father/mother is (barring brothel customers and other transient characters)
- A small assortment of items to interact with pregnancy (can be disabled if users feel that they dilute the item pool too much)
