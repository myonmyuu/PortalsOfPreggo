# PortalsOfPreggo
A pregnancy expansion for Portals of Phereon.

# Content
- Female/Futa characters have menstrual cycles
- Characters' wombs can have multipe Ovums/Eggs
- All (pretty much all) sexual activity involving both a penis and a vagina will cause sperm transfer into the recipient
- the contents (ovums, eggs, sperm) of a character's uterus is displayer via a small window

  it can be expanded to show the name and species of the donor
- eggs are formed in the womb after a successful impregnation

  they take time to grow, and are added to the egg inventory after birth

## Farm/Hatching
- eggs keep track of who the father/mother is (barring brothel customers and other transient characters)
  - characters can refer to you as Mom/Dad if you are one of the parents (configurable)
 
## Items
A small assortment of items to interact with pregnancy (can be disabled if users feel that they dilute the item pool too much).
All items affect a single character.

### Common 
- Weak Pregnancy Accelerator
  - Progresses all active pregnancies by 30%
- Ovulatory Stimulant
  - Progresses the menstural cycle (~3 charges needed to get from start of Menstruation to Ovulation)
### Rare
- Strong Pregnancy Accelerator
  - Progresses all active pregnancies by 70%
- Egg Transmitter
  - "Moves fertilized/implanted eggs to a nest in a different world." I don't think I need to elaborate what that means
- Birth Control Potion
  - Enables/Disables ovulation
### Legendary
- Pregnancy Finalizer
  - Immediately completes all active pregnancies
- Fertility Cure
  - Removes the Infertile trait from a character (or adds Fertile)
- Ovulation Potion
  - Immediately causes target to ovulate

Male/Futa characters also have a new option in their character screen, "Collect Cum". For 1 energy, attain a cum potion for that character. Using this potion on a character inserts a load of cum into them from the relevant character.
Due to how the game saves items, these cum potions *do not* persist when saving & loading, so make sure to use all uses or sell them before quitting.

## Brothel
Characters working at a brothel (show rooms exempt) will have cum added from random customers as days pass.

## Dates
The player character and date partner can cum inside each other when the appropriate cards are played.
Vaginally penetrating actions will take virginities (configurable)

## Events
When certain events trigger, cum can be added to involved characters. These events are triggerable through Lua. One example is featured (Sylvie & Castalia portal event).

I probably forgot something...
